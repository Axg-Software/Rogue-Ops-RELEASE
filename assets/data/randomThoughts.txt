Im thinking instead of the map actually having collisions its just the visual map and then the collisions are just FlxSprites because
Im too lazy to make the actual map have collisions

decided to just make the maps pngs instead of full .tmx files
still gonna leave the things tho for modders if there are any lmao

CO-OP GAME MODE:
It would be a capture the flag type game where there would be a flag on blue side and red side
blue would try to get red 
red would try to get blue etc
and when u have flag u can not shoot the gun and to shoot the gun u have to drop the flag

bro idk if im gonna be able to do the campaign and if i do its gonna be alot shorter than i wanted it to be

Im going to scrap the first co-op level (which is unfortunate because of how much time i spent on it)
but because of a bug idk how to fix yet the only way to avoid the bug is to have a bigger map so ima just do dat.
